# Dark admin portal SCSS fronted framework

This SCSS fronted framework was create for me to develop web application using pure SCSS and compiled to CSS3. This make for a much more optimized, efficient, propose build for the job. Its is also build open semantic and using native HTML5 syntax.

Dark and mobile first, this is the name of game.

This will be the most clean looking semantic frontend framework ever. css `class` is only need when absolutely unavoidable. html `tag` will be the native way for this framework to work.
